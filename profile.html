        <h3 class="about">About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello everyone reading this website. A few of my interests include video games, working out, and soccer. Out of the three though 
            I enjoy working out and bodybuiling the most. I recently competed in 
            a bodybuilding show. I always wanted to do coding but other things in life caught my attention and I steered away from this path for awhile. 
            I am going into the cybersercuity speciality after the foundations course and I want to work for a well known company. I also think building websites is cool,
            I am just not good at designing so I will have other people do the designing and I will do the code part.
        </p>
